Intall Angular Globally
ng new [name of app] <[--no-strict]>
cd [name of app]
ng serve


ng-serve -> main.ts -> appmobule -> app.component -> gets rendered in the html


Component has 3 parts:
1. Template - represents the view (HTML)
2. Class - supports the view (Typescript) - contains data and methods
3. Metadata - Information that angular needs to decide.

Create a component - ng g c [name of component]
